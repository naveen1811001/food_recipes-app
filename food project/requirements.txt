This file lists all the dependencies needed for your project. 
Since your project is primarily using front-end technologies and fetching data via an API, the requirements are minimal.
flask                # If using Flask for a backend server (optional)
requests             # For making API requests in Python (optional)
If your project is purely front-end without any Python/Flask backend, you might not need this file. 
But if you're planning to expand the project with a backend, this setup will be helpful.
